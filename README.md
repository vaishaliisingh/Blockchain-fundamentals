# Blockchain-fundamentals

 Basic Blockchain Implementation:
This project is a simple blockchain implementation in Python. It demonstrates how a basic blockchain works, including block creation, proof of work, and transaction handling. The project also includes a mining reward feature for miners who successfully add new blocks to the blockchain.

## Features

- **Block Creation**: New blocks can be created and added to the blockchain. Each block contains a list of transactions, a proof of work, a timestamp, and a hash linking to the previous block.
- **Proof of Work**: A simple proof of work algorithm is implemented to secure the blockchain. This helps ensure that the blockchain is tamper-proof.
- **Transaction Handling**: Transactions between different participants are recorded on the blockchain.
- **Mining Reward**: Miners are rewarded with a fixed amount of cryptocurrency for successfully mining a block.

## Code Structure

- **Blockchain Class**: The main class that handles the creation of blocks, proof of work, transaction management, and blockchain validation.
- **Proof of Work Method**: The method that implements the proof of work algorithm, ensuring the security of the blockchain.
- **Transaction Method**: A method to add new transactions to the blockchain.
- **Mining Reward**: A reward mechanism that grants miners a fixed amount of cryptocurrency when they successfully mine a block.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-project.git
   cd blockchain-project
   python blockchain.py
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   This project doesn't require any external dependencies, as it relies on core Python libraries.
3. **Run the Code**: You can run the blockchain code using Python:
   ```bash
       python blockchain.py
4. **Add Transactions**: You can manually add transactions to the blockchain by modifying the new_transaction method call in the code.
5. **Mine a New Block**: After adding transactions, mine a new block using the proof_of_work method.

## Example Output

When you run the code, you will see output similar to the following:
  
  New block created: 
  {
  'index': 2, 
  'timestamp': 1725686992.3320613, 
  'transactions': [
    {'sender': 'Alice', 'recipient': 'Bob', 'amount': 50}, 
    {'sender': '0', 'recipient': 'Miner1', 'amount': 1}
  ], 
  'proof': 35293, 
  'previous_hash': '6eeb66a1882d22b4b6f33ec057d241af2f46ba6d51837d2b72ed94e4fcad7aed'
   }

 ## Future Scope
 
Here are some additional features that can be added to this blockchain implementation:
1. Blockchain Validation (Valid Chain): Implement a method to validate the entire blockchain and ensure it has not been tampered with.
2. Consensus Algorithm: Implement a consensus algorithm to ensure all nodes in a network agree on the same blockchain.
3. Merkle Trees: Improve transaction handling by implementing Merkle trees, which would help efficiently verify the contents of a block.
4. Networking: Extend this project by enabling communication between multiple nodes (computers), allowing them to share and synchronize their blockchain.
